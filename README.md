Project 8 - SQL Library Manager

This is an application for a local library to help manage a collection of books.

This app uses Express, Pug, Sequelize and SQLite to setup a database of books and render pages for adding, deleting and updating books.

Instructions:

- Be sure to be in the project folder;

- Run "npm install" to add all dependencies;

- Run "npm start" to launch the application;

The application will run on localhost:3000.

I've added a search feature and a pagination feature.

Search works for all fields and is case insensitive.

You can test the pagination system changing the number of books per page.
You can do it by changing the variable "booksPerPage" in the Pagination Route in routes/books.js.
